# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify social network users based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`.

## Files in this Repository

- **`Knearest.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the KNN model.
- **`Social_Network_Ads.csv`**: Dataset containing user information and purchase behavior.

##  Dataset Description

The `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset consists of:

- **User ID** (ignored in the analysis)
- **Age** (input feature)
- **Estimated Salary** (input feature)
- **Purchased** (target variable: 0 or 1)

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
3. Splitting data into training and test sets
4. Applying feature scaling
5. Training the KNN classifier
6. Evaluating the model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization
